    <p>This component displays multiple map instances based on different periods and years.</p>
    <p>
        The Map Grid Component initializes multiple maps for the specified periods (WET and DRY) and years (2017 to
        2023).
        It uses OpenLayers to render map tiles from a remote server. Users can interact with the maps to update center
        coordinates.
